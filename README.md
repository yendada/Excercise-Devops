# Excercise-Devops

The basic idea of this repo, is to depict all the steps that I have done to perform various tasks in the Devops excercise, 
as suggested by Massi.

** Also these steps should be useful to someone who is trying to learn Devops tasks using Kubernetes via Minikube tool on Windows platform.**
